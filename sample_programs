Sample Programs - Provide 3 sample programs that tests the capability of the implemented compiler/interpreter.
1) The first sample program should be a program that outputs all leap years within a range of years inputted by the user.
2) The second sample program will be your preference but make sure it can show the capability of your programming language.
3) The third sample program will be a program to test your debugger. Pepper your test files with comments.

C code:
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
int year;
int min_year,max_year;

printf("Enter the lowest year: ");
scanf("%d",&min_year);

printf("Enter the heighest year: ");
scanf("%d",&max_year);

printf("Leap years in given range are: ");
for(year = min_year;year <= max_year; year++){
if(((year%4==0)&&(year%100!=0))||(year%400==0))
printf("%d ",year);
}

return 0;
}


HashCode:
@int year
@int min_year
@int max_year

#print "Enter the lowest year: "
#read min_year

#print "Enter the highest year: "
#read max_year

#print "Leap years in given range are: "

#for (year = min_year; year <= max_year; year++)
#if (((year%4 == 0) and (year%100 != 0)) or (year % 400 == 0))
#print "#{year}"
#end
